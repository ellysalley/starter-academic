According to the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (after this referred to as MSIP), Samsung Electronics dominated the smartphone market share with an average of about 60% in the first half of the year. Based on this report, ZOYI Corporation analyzed mobile phone wireless signals, the number of mobile populations, and the market share of major regions from January to June 2015. 
 
According to the report, Samsung continued to dominate the smartphone market in all regions, with 61.6% share in the residential area. Especially in Seocho-dong(Seocho-gu) and Dogok-dong(Gangnam-gu) has soared to a maximum of 67.3% share. 
 
However, Samsung was not able to exert its relative strength in many commercial areas, which has many foreigners. In Myeong-dong, where there are many Chinese tourists, Samsung has an average of 39%, and Apple has a 33% share. The share of Samsung and Apple is not much different in Myeong-dong, except that the percentage of Samsung increased slightly in June, while the number of tourists has plunged due to the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Also, in Hongdae, Itaewon, and Samsung-dong, filled with many foreigners and young people, Samsung accounted for less than 45% of the average market share. 
 
On the other hand, Apple maintained an average market share of around 21% throughout the region, but its market share in the residential area decreased to 12%. This relatively small market share of Apple is attributed mainly to the fact that young Apple users are less active in the residential areas. 
 
LG Electronics had the highest market share at 16.6% in the IFC Mall, where the LG’s headquarters is located, while maintaining an average market share of 12%. 
 
"We can estimate the age range of each region to some degree from the data collected from sensors and Wi-Fi signals installed in the shopping area," said Elly Han, Insight Director of ZOYI corporation. "Apple's market share outperformed area means many younger generations are active in there, and Samsung’s share dominated area means that there are a lot of housewives, teenagers, and relatively older generations who live in the residential areas," she said.
